let x: Int = 10
let y: Int = 20
let average = (x + y)/2

// 3.
// To solve the problem, just change the type of constants x & y into the type Double .
// The differences between (10/3) & (10.0/3.0) is that the previous is type Int , and the follow is type Double or as known as Float.

// Equality operator : ==
//For example
1 == 2

// 8.
// Differences between let and var : let is constant, which means the value assigning to it is unmutable; while var (variable) opposites to let, the value assigning to a var is mutable.

// 9.
// Donot start with a number
// No whitespace characters, special characters, mathematical symbols
// Use CamelCases

// 10.
// Type Inference means that when you don't specify the constant or variable or others, the compiler automatically deduce the type of a particular expression by examining the values you provide.

// 11.
// The value assign to phoneNumber should be the type Int (integer) , while "Hello World" is the type of String.
